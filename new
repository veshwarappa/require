Global Access & Multi-Region Strategy for AI Agent Platform


Summary: What needs to be done to make the app global

· Add Azure Front Door as a single global entry point for the application

· Use Front Door to route users (UK, EU, AU) to the nearest Azure edge, improving latency

· Keep Azure Container Apps as backends, with Front Door as the only public-facing component

· Enable WAF, TLS, and health probes on Front Door for security and resilience

· Deploy the same application stack in multiple regions (e.g. Australia East + UK South)

· Configure Front Door for latency-based routing and automatic failover

· Implement a data strategy (primary DB + replicas or active/passive)

· Keep security intact using private endpoints, managed identities, and RBAC


Global Architecture

The target architecture enables global access for users in regions such as the UK, EU, and APAC using Azure-native global routing and optional multi-region deployments.

Phase 1: Global Entry Point using Azure Front Door

Azure Front Door (Standard/Premium) will be introduced as a global entry point. - Provides a single global URL - Routes users via Microsoft edge locations - Improves latency for international users - Supports WAF, TLS termination, and health probes Traffic Flow: User → Azure Front Door → Container Apps (Australia East)

Phase 2: Multi-Region Deployment

To improve resilience and reduce latency further, the application stack can be deployed in multiple regions such as Australia East and UK South.

Each region will have: - Dedicated Container Apps Environment - Regional networking and private endpoints - Independent scaling Azure Front Door will route traffic based on latency and health checks.

Data Strategy

Database and state management options include: - Primary database with read replicas in secondary regions - Active/passive regional databases - Region-local storage and queues for async workloads

Security Considerations

Security remains unchanged and includes: - Private Endpoints for all core services - Azure AD authentication (single tenant) - Managed Identities and RBAC - Azure Front Door as the only public-facing component

Operational Benefits

This approach enables: - Global performance optimization - High availability and disaster recovery - Minimal application changes - Alignment with SRE and Azure Well-Architected Framework

Conclusion

By introducing Azure Front Door and progressively adopting a multi-region strategy, the AI Agent platform can be safely and effectively made global without compromising security or operational standards.
